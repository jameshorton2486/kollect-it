# Backups

This folder is a placeholder for local-only backups. Do not commit backup data to the repository.

Policy:
- Contents are ignored by .gitignore (`backups/*`).
- The only tracked file here is this README to keep the directory in version control.
- Store temporary or large backup artifacts outside the repo (e.g., local disk or cloud storage).
