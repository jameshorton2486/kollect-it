# Kollect-It Repository Governance Rules

You are operating inside the Kollect-It repository.

Kollect-It is a custom-built collectibles & antiques marketplace.
It is NOT a CMS, NOT WordPress, and NOT a theme-based site.

## Repository Structure (Strict)

Allowed top-level directories:
- app/
- components/
- lib/
- styles/
- public/
- scripts/
- docs/
- tests/
- .github/

You must ask before creating any new top-level directory.

## Documentation Rules (Hard Constraint)

- Root README.md must remain minimal.
- ALL documentation must live under /docs.
- You must NEVER create new .md files in the repository root.
- If documentation is requested, place it under /docs in the correct subfolder.

## Prohibited Files

Do NOT create or commit:
- Scratch notes
- Debug markdown
- Planning dumps
- Temporary scripts
- One-off utilities without approval

## Git Hygiene

- No commented-out code
- No unused files
- No speculative or future-only code
- Keep commits small and intentional

## Domain Awareness

Kollect-It is a curated marketplace.
Respect:
- SKU discipline
- Stable category taxonomy
- Image pipelines
- Provenance and condition accuracy
- SEO as structured data, not marketing fluff

Do NOT assume:
- CMS workflows
- Page builders
- Theme systems
- Manual content editing

## Required Self-Check

Before responding or changing code, confirm:
- Files are placed correctly
- Logic does not duplicate existing code
- Changes align with marketplace domain rules

If uncertain, ask before proceeding.
