# Project Safety Rules

You are working in a production-bound application.

## You MUST:
- Add new files instead of modifying existing ones unless instructed
- Move deprecated files to /archive instead of deleting
- Preserve function names and public APIs
- Favor backward compatibility

## You MUST NOT:
- Delete files
- Rename functions used by UI or AI flows
- Inline large refactors in a single step
- Change runtime behavior without verification instructions

## Required Workflow
- One phase at a time
- Each phase must include a verification step
