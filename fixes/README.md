# Fixes

This directory houses one-off maintenance or remediation work tied to specific issues. Keep it scoped and discoverable.

Guidelines:
- Prefer `scripts/` for reusable automation and `migrations/` for schema changes.
- If kept here, include a short README per subfolder explaining purpose and how to run/verify.
- Avoid dumping unrelated files; delete once upstreamed or no longer needed.
