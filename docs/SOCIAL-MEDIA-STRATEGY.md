# 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY - INSTAGRAM + PINTEREST

**Start with these two platforms. Evaluate TikTok/Facebook later based on time and traction.**

---

## 🎯 WHY INSTAGRAM + PINTEREST?

### INSTAGRAM ✅

- **Why:** Visual-first platform, perfect for collectibles
- **Audience:** Collectors, enthusiasts, buyers aged 25-65
- **Goal:** Build community, showcase items, drive traffic
- **Posting:** 3-4x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat)
- **Content:** Product photos, behind-the-scenes, educational, seller stories

### PINTEREST ✅

- **Why:** Visual search engine, people actively searching for collectibles
- **Audience:** Buyers with intent, collectors planning purchases
- **Goal:** Drive traffic to website, build SEO backlinks
- **Posting:** Daily (or 3-5x weekly via scheduler)
- **Content:** Educational pins, category showcases, how-to guides, item features

### FUTURE CONSIDERATION (Phase 5+)

- **TikTok:** Maybe later (younger audience, shorter videos, different skill needed)
- **Facebook:** Consider later (less visual-first, more community management needed)
- **Twitter:** Skip for now (not visual enough, wrong audience)
