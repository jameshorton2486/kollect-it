Copy and paste this entire message to ChatGPT:

## CONTEXT

I've implemented the design system you created (Cormorant Garamond + Inter). Claude has:

1. ✅ Updated `layout.tsx` to load Inter instead of Lato
2. ✅ Updated `globals.css` with new typography utilities:
   - `.heading-page` (gold, responsive 2.2rem → 3.2rem)
   - `.heading-section` (gold, responsive 1.8rem → 2.6rem)  
   - `.heading-subsection` (charcoal)
   - `.text-label` (uppercase, tracking-widest)
   - `.text-muted` (gray-light)
   - `.btn-primary` (gold background)
   - `.btn-secondary` (gold border, transparent)
3. ✅ Created deployment script with automatic backups

## REQUEST

Now I need the **homepage wireframe** you mentioned. Please provide:

### 1. VISUAL WIREFRAME
A text-based or ASCII wireframe showing the homepage layout with:
- Exact section order
- Content placement
- Grid structures

### 2. SECTION-BY-SECTION SPECIFICATIONS

For each homepage section, tell me:
- **Section name**
- **Background** (which `lux-*` color)
- **Spacing** (which `.section-*` class)
- **Typography** (which heading classes)
- **Content** (what goes in this section)
- **Grid** (columns, gaps)

### 3. HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE (per your design system)

According to your design system, the homepage should have:
1. Hero Section (cream background)
2. Recent Additions Grid (4–8 items)
3. Category Grid (2x2)
4. Value / Trust Bar
5. Consignment Teaser
6. Footer

Please expand on each of these with specific implementation details.

### 4. HERO SECTION DETAILS

For the hero specifically:
- Headline text suggestion
- Subheadline/tagline
- CTA button text
- Whether to include a product preview card
- Image placement (if any)

### 5. MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS

How should each section adapt on mobile?
